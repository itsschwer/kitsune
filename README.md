[![Datapacks](https://img.shields.io/badge/See_more-datapacks-C7A978.svg)](https://github.com/itsschwer?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=mcfunction&sort=)

A small datapack implementing a new type of interaction with Foxes.

## Intention

This datapack aims to expand on the ability of Foxes to pick up items by adding a Fox variant *(Kitsune)* that can 'bless' items.

This datapack is intended and designed to be integrated with other datapack as a means of modifying items *(similar to custom crafting with NBT data)*. Example of datapacks that integrate with *kitsune* include *[pseudo-enchantments](https://github.com/itsschwer/pseudo-enchantments)* and *[radiance](https://github.com/itsschwer/radiance)*.

Datapack creators can refer to the *[Integration](#integration)* section to learn how to connect their datapack(s) to *kitsune*.

## Guide
*This datapack was developed in 1.17 (`"pack_format": 7`) but should be compatible with versions using an equivalent or greater `pack_format`, barring major changes to commands/datapacks.*

2. Install into a save like any other datapack.
